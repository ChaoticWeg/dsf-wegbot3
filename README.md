# Wegbot

Yet another Wegbot rewrite. This time in Python, because the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) rewrite 
fits our use case _so much_ better than [discord.js](https://discord.js.org). This is not a joke.

## Commands

Commands are specifically-formatted messages that interact with the bot in different ways. You want the bot 
to do something for you? You put a command in the chat. Note that all commands _depend_ on having been used 
in a public channel, so unless otherwise specified, you cannot DM commands to the bot.

Note that only verified users can use commands.

### Public commands

These commands are open to public use by all verified Discord members.

- `?roles` - List eligible roles.
    - Notes:
        - The only public version of this command is the parameter-less `?roles`, exactly as written.
        - This command is functionally equivalent to `?roles list`, which is detailed below with [restricted commands](#restricted-commands).

- `?addrole <role_name>` - Request a role.
    - Parameters:
        - `role_name` - The name of the role you want to request, or **all** to request all eligible roles.
    - Notes:
        - Only eligible roles can be requested. Use `?roles` for a list of eligible roles.
        - Multiple roles can be requested by providing a comma-separated list of role names.
        - All eligible roles can be requested at once by using `?addrole all`.

- `?removerole <role_name>` - Relinquish a role.
    - Parameters:
        - `role_name` - The name of the role you want to relinquish.
    - Notes:
        - Roles can be relinquished in the same way that they are requested, so the same notes for `?addrole` apply here.

### Restricted Commands

These commands are only available to elevated users, known to common folk as "moderators" or "mods". ðŸ‘€

- `?roles add <role_name>` - Declare a role eligible to be requested. 
    - Parameters:
        - `role_name` - The name of the role to be declared eligible.
    - Notes:
        - Mod roles cannot be declared eligible to be requested, for obvious reasons.

- `?roles remove <role_name>` - Declare a role **no longer** eligible to be requested.
    - Parameters:
        - `role_name` - The name of the eligible role to be declared ineligible.

### Owner-only Commands

These commands are only available to me (`weg`) as the owner of the bot.

Currently several owner-only commands have been implemented, but documentation for those is still in progress.

## Extensions

Extensions are actions that the bot takes on its own. Extensions may be triggered by user input, or by some events 
firing behind the scenes.

- BRO
    - Responds to "BRO" with "BRO" (among other things). Pretty straightforward. Inspired by `Missy` in the DSF 
    server, among others.
- Pinner
    - Pins messages that garner enough "ðŸ“Œ" reactions. The threshold at which messages are pinned can be managed by the 
    bot owner using `?kv set pin_threshold <number>`.
    - Note: the bot requires the `manage_messages` permission in the channel where the message was posted to be able to 
    pin the message, else `discord.py` raises a
    [`discord.Forbidden`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Forbidden) exception. If this 
    exception is caught, the bot will notify admins that it needs the proper permission for that channel.
